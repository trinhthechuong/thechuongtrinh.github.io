## MolUtil
- Molecular standardization
- Molecular representation: 4 descriptors and 16 fingerprints
- Chemical space visualization
- Statistical test for decision making: which type of fingerprint is suitable or reference compound that enhance performance
- Ensemble learning: stacking technique

### Tanimoto similarity

$$T _{c}(A,B) = \frac{c}{a+b-c}$$

- a: number of features present in molecule A 
- b: number of features present in molecule B 
- c: number of features shared by molecules A and B
