# Statistical Test for Machine Learning Model Performance Comparison

## Overview

This repository offers a Python `Statistical_test` package for comparing the performance of machine learning models through statistical tests. Two approaches are implemented: Bayesian estimation and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 

## Code example
```python
# Import the Statistical package and statistical_test function
from Statistical_test import statistical_test

# Input the list of models cross-validation scores, names of your implemented models, X_train, and y_train with your actual data and training sets
model_compare = statistical_test(results=list_results, model=name, X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)

# Bayesian estimation
bayesian_df = model_compare.bayesian_comparison()

# Wilcoxon signed-rank test
df_pvalue = model_compare.wilcoxon_comparison()  # Calculating p-value

# Boxplot visualization
model_compare.boxplot_comparision(show_pvalue=True)

# Heatmap visualization
model_compare.posthoc_comparison(title="Comparison heatmap Wilcoxon", save=False)
```

## Example notebook
