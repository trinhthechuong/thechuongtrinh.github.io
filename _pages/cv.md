Research experience
======
* **Sep 2023 - Aug 2024: MASTER INTERNSHIP**
  **Supervisor: [Prof. Achène BOUMENDJEL, PhD, RadioPharmaceutiques Bioclinique Laboratory (LRB), UGA, Inserm U1039.**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahcene-Boumendjel)
  In addition to my background in Cheminformatics, I have had the opportunity to explore the impact of AI in healthcare projects, including causal inference and longitudinal data analysis. I've been fortunate to work on the analysis of multi-omics datasets, which encompass metabolomics, transcriptomics, modeling of biological networks, genomics, and epigenomics. Moreover, I've had the privilege of gaining insights into innovative strategies for discovering new drug candidates, with a special emphasis on antibiotics.
  **Master thesis**: Leveraging sophisticated molecular modeling tools, including Artificial Intelligence, the project focuses on proposing innovative drug candidates targeting either GPX4 for anticancer applications or the Cdr1 transporter for antifungal agents.
