Personal information
======
I am The-Chuong TRINH, a pharmacy student in the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City. My research interests are applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to solving challenging problems in pharmaceutical chemistry, drug discovery, and cheminformatics. This is a place where I store my projects and some fundamental code during my research.


Research interests
======
My primary research interests involve:  
- Development of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models using machine learning algorithms
- Develop a Deep learning models (ANN, CNN, GNN) indentifying a potential lead compound. 
- Computer-aided drug design methodologies developement
- Synthesis of biologically active molecules

My research focuses on these main problems in drug discovery:
1. **Generative molecules**: given a target (protein) and database of active-inactive molecules, how can we generate agonists/antagonists?
2. **Retrosynthesis strategy**: given a set of compounds and conditions, which compounds could be synthesized, and what is the probability of this reaction?


Our team - MedAI

Established in 2021 with students from the organic chemistry sector, we try to catch up with the innovation of artificial intelligence in drug discovery.
