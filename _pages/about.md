Personal information
======
A dedicated Master’s student at Grenoble Alpes University, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in the dynamic fields of advanced machine learning for innovative drug discovery (AIDD), cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and precision medicine. My research interests are **lead compound identification and optimization, cheminformatics tool developments, generative molecules, precision medicine, and retrosynthesis strategy**. Eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to cutting-edge research, I am poised to embark on the next phase of my academic journey.


Research interests
======
My primary research interests involve:
- Advanced Machine Learning for Innovative Drug Discovery (AIDD) 
- Drug Discovery – Identification and Optimization of lead compounds
- Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics
- Precision medicine
- Synthesis of biologically active molecules

My research focuses on these main problems in drug discovery:
1. **Identification and optimzation drug candidate**: given a target (protein) and database of active-inactive molecules, how can we discover and design the most potentital candidates?
2. **Developing AIDD methodologies**: creating and developing techniques and tools for AIDD. 
3. **Generative molecules**: given a target (protein) and database of active-inactive molecules, how can we generate and design agonists/antagonists?
4. **Retrosynthesis strategy**: given a set of compounds and conditions, which compounds could be synthesized, and what is the probability of this reaction?
