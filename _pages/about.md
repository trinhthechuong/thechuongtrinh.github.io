Personal information
======
I am The-Chuong TRINH, a dedicated and passionate Master's student at Grenoble Alpes University, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in the dynamic fields of Computer-Aided Drug Discovery, Cheminformatics, and Bioinformatics.  My research interests are Computer-Aided Drug Discovery and Development, Lead compound identification, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics and the application of Machine Learning/Deep Learning methodologies. This is a place where I store my projects and some fundamental code during my research.


Research interests
======
My primary research interests involve: 
- Computer – Aided Drug Discovery and Development
- Drug Discovery – Identification of lead compounds
- Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics
- Application Machine learning / Deep learning in Drug Discovery
- Computer-aided drug design methodologies developement
- Synthesis of biologically active molecules

My research focuses on these main problems in drug discovery:
1. **Identifying drug candidate**: given a target (protein) and database of active-inactive molecules, how can we filter the most potentital candidates?
2. **Developing CADD methodologies**: creating and developing techniques and tools for Computer-Aided Drug Discovery. 
3. **Generative molecules**: given a target (protein) and database of active-inactive molecules, how can we generate and design agonists/antagonists?
4. **Retrosynthesis strategy**: given a set of compounds and conditions, which compounds could be synthesized, and what is the probability of this reaction?
