Personal information
======
An 18-year-old lad with a Pharmacy degree and a Master's in BioHealth Engineering, I am now pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics. Three words that describe me—compassionate, confident, and conscientious—all align with the first letter of my name. Eager to apply my skills and knowledge to cutting-edge research, I am poised to embark on the next phase of my academic journey.



Research interests
======
My primary research interests involve:
- Advanced Machine Learning for Innovative Drug Discovery (AIDD)
- Drug Discovery – Identification and Optimization of lead compounds
- Application Artificial Intelligence for OneHealth, Multi-omics
- Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics 

My research focuses on these main problems in drug discovery:
1. **Identification and optimization of drug candidates**: How can we discover and design the most promising candidates given a target (protein) and a database of active and inactive molecules?
2. **Developing AIDD methodologies**: Creating and advancing techniques and tools for AIDD.
3. **Omics data**: Developing Pharmacogenomics AI models to leverage omics data for drug discovery.
4. **Reaction modeling**: Given a set of compounds and conditions, which compounds could be synthesized, and what is the likelihood of this reaction?
