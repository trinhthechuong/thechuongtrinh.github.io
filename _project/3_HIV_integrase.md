# Abstract
HIV Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) had been a trend in HIV treatment
research in recent years. Many studies had shown that inhibiting the strand transfer
of integrase would prevent the spread of the virus, prolonging the survival time for
the host. The application of in silico models would help shorten the time, effort and
resources to research and develop new potential HIV integrase inhibitors in HIV
treatment.

## Workflow
The project contains four parts:
- Pharmacophore modeling: automated results extraction and comparasion; ensemble learning to enhance performance
- QSAR (Classification and regression tasks): develop full data pipeline and statistical test
- Molecular docking: using five docking softwares to perform retrospective control
